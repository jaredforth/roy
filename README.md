## Documentation

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
roy = "0.1"
```

## Usage

To use any of the methods on the `roy::Client` struct, it has to be instantiated as follows:

```rust
// import into scope
use roy::Client;
// Instantiate `Client` with your API's base URL
let c = roy::Client::new("https://httpbin.org".to_string());  
```

All of the examples below assume that the struct has already been instantiated.

### GET

```rust
c.get("/get", false); // Make a GET request to your endpoint
```

### POST

```rust
c.post("/post", "{some: data}"); // Make a POST request to your endpoint
```

### PATCH

```rust
c.patch("/patch", "{some: data}"); // Make a PATCH request to your endpoint
```

### PUT

```rust
c.put("/put", "{some: data}"); // Make a PUT request to your endpoint
```

### DELETE

```rust
c.delete("/delete"); // Make a DELETE request to your endpoint
```

## Behind the Name

This crate is named after [Roy Fielding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roy_Fielding), who defined Representational State Transfer. According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer#History): 

> Roy Fielding defined REST in his 2000 PhD dissertation "Architectural Styles and the Design of Network-based Software Architectures" at UC Irvine. He developed the REST architectural style in parallel with HTTP 1.1 of 1996â€“1999, based on the existing design of HTTP 1.0 of 1996.
